# Linked List Implementation in TypeScript

This is a simple implementation of a linked list in TypeScript. The linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each of which points to the next element in the sequence. The linked list is a dynamic data structure, which means that it can grow or shrink in size during the execution of a program.

## Running the Code

Start by making sure you have the dependencies installed. Do this by running:

```bash
npm install
```

The only script exposed by this project is `test`. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
